## PrÃ©-requisitos:

Before starting you need to have installed the following tools:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Also is nice to have a API Tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to interact with the API.

## How to run

```bash
# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/jvictore/api-my-books.git

# Enter the cloned project folder 
$ cd api-my-books

# Just in case you already have a compose running, drop it
$ docker-compose down

# Build the project
$ docker-compose build --no-cache

# Initialize the application
$ docker-compose up -d

# The Flask REST API will initialize on port 5000.
# Access the application by <http://localhost:5000/>

# You'll need the auth user/password, that by default is:
# User: 	user
# Password: 1234
```
